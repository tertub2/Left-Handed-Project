# Left-Handed-Project

Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Babe Ruth, and Marie Curie are among the famous left-handed people. A 1991 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that left-handed people die on average **nine years earlier** than right-handed people, which seems hard to believe. However, a 2005 study by Bland and Altman concluded that left-handedness is **only slightly** associated with an increased risk of death, nowhere near the 9 years  suggested by the previous study. It is unclear if the majority of people in the world will die younger because of left-handedness.

A National Geographic survey in 1986 found that rates of left-handedness were around 13% for people under 40 but decreased to about 5% by the age of 80. However, researchers Avery Gilbert and Charles Wysocki concluded that this age-dependence was primarily due to changing social acceptability of left-handedness, rather than age specifically. Thus, the rates of left-handedness **are more a factor of the year you were born, rather than your age**. If the same study were conducted today, we would expect a shifted version of the same distribution as a function of age. The changing rate of left-handedness over time may have an effect on the apparent mean age of death of left-handed people, but further research is needed to confirm this.

This notebook aims to explore the **changing rates of left-handedness over time using age distribution data**. It uses pandas and Bayesian statistics to analyze the probability of being a certain age at death based on hand preference. By examining the data, the notebook hopes to refute the claim that left-handed people die younger.



With this in mind, some points were made for this project to have sequence: 

### Where are the old left-handed people?

### Rates of left-handedness over time

### Applying Bayes' rule

### When do people normally die?

### The overall probability of left-handedness

### Putting it all together: dying while left-handed (i)

### Putting it all together: dying while left-handed (ii)

### Plotting the distributions of conditional probabilities

### Moment of truth: age of left and right-handers at death

### Final comments
